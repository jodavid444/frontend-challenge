                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
                been
                looking to make a transition and have heared some people who had
                an 
                amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
                and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. the next
                12
                week was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. since
                completing the course, I've sucessfully switch careers,
                working as
                a Software Engineer at a VR start up."

            <p class="card-quotes">
                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                100% recommend! ”
